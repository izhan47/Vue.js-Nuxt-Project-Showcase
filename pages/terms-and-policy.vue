    <h1>Policy for Product Reviews</h1>
    <p>
      The Federal Trade Commission requires that we disclose any relationship we
      have between a product manufacturer or service provider. It is important
      for you as a consumer to understand our relationships with brands and
      products.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If we mention a product or a service in any of our videos, we do so as
        part of our commitment to educating dog owners. Wag Enabled absorbs all
        costs associated with acquiring the product or service and the
        production of the video about said product or service.
      </li>
      <li>
        Payment to create a Product Review will in no way affect our opinion of
        those products or services. We only endorse products that align with our
        ideals, would be of value to our viewers, and benefit your dog.
